The youngest Morgan, Elijah, has completed his first week of Kindergarten. On Monday, Elijah, his mom, and his dad visited his new classroom for a brief overview of what would be happening during the upcoming school year. There was also a large stack of forms to fill out. Elijah and his new classmates (just half of the total 25) met their teacher, Mrs. Mikek before they left on a tour of the building.
